# Alt Alpha Ranker

This project allows you to compare alternative keyboard layouts and allows you to try out new layouts.

See it live at https://altalpha.timvink.nl/

## Adding new layouts

The aim is that users can explore and compare layouts that they can choose to actually adopt.
So new layouts should be finished, and have a website link (to post/announcement/github repo) where the author explains the reasoning behind the layout.

## Explore the data yourself?

You might be interested to run your own analytics on the data, for example when developing your own layout. 

See [`site/data.json`](https://github.com/timvink/alt_alpha_ranker/blob/main/site/data.json) for the raw data.
